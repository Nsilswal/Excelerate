Excelerate is a cool personal project of mine which - pushes the limit of viewing csv data - . Microsoft excel has a limit of 1,048,576 Rows. This project should be able to handle an infinite number of rows and run quickly on legacy hardware. 

This is acomplished by loading the data into a sql database and performing pagination - behind the scenes we load 'pages' of data as you scroll improving speed.
